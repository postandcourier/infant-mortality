###### Q: I just found out I’m pregnant, but I don’t have health insurance. What do I do?

A: Depending on your income, you might qualify for Medicaid coverage. The easiest way to check is to call 1-888-549-0820 or visit the agency’s online application, apply.scdhhs.gov. 

Even if you already have health insurance, depending on your income, you may qualify for Medicaid as secondary coverage. In that case, Medicaid could help cover some of the out-of-pocket expenses not covered by private insurance. 

Even if you’re not sure if you qualify, don’t hesitate to call a doctor or hospital and set up your first appointment. If your application is approved, Medicaid will retroactively cover your prenatal medical bills even if it takes some time to do your paperwork. 

If you make too much money for Medicaid, look at the answer to the next question.


###### Q: I’ve been denied Medicaid coverage and I’m pregnant. How can I afford prenatal care?

A: First, consider private health insurance. An insurance agent or broker can help you consider your options. 

Insurance navigators at The Palmetto Project, 1-843-577-4122, may also help. This nonprofit group has been trained by the federal government to help customers enroll in coverage. Their services are free.

If you can’t afford private insurance, you still need to make an appointment to see a doctor or a health care professional. Try calling a local health center, such as the federally subsidized Fetter Health Network in Charleston County. Similar federally funded, low-income clinics are located across the state. They offer health care services to uninsured patients and charge discounted, flat fees, which are calculated based on your income. 

Call the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association, 1-803-788-2778, or visit the association’s website, www.scphca.org, to find a health center near you. 


###### Q: I don’t have a car. How do I get to the doctor’s office?

A: If you’re covered by Medicaid, you can get a ride to your appointments, but you need to call Logisticare, 1-866-445-9954, at least three days in advance of your next office visit. 

If you’re not covered by Medicaid, you might consider seeing a doctor whose office easily can be reached by public transportation. For example, both the MUSC Women’s Care clinic in North Charleston and the Fetter Health Network on the peninsula are within short walking distance of public bus lines.

If you’re experiencing some medical emergency, call 911 for an ambulance. 



###### Q: There’s no doctor or hospital in the county I live in that delivers babies. Where do I go?

A: It’s very possible that you live in a county that offers no obstetrical services. Even if you do live near a hospital, some of them, especially in rural areas, don’t deliver babies anymore. 

Nevertheless, find the location of your closest hospital. Call the hospital or a doctor’s office for advice. You may also consider using a licensed midwife to handle delivery at home or at a birth center if your pregnancy is uncomplicated. Visit the state health department’s website, www.scdhec.gov, for more information. 

If you’re going to need to travel a significant distance to deliver your baby, make sure you’re ready ahead of time. Arrange for transportation and pack a bag for your hospital stay in advance.



###### Q: What can I do to give my baby the best chance of being healthy?

A: Find a doctor who offers prenatal medical care. Seeing a health care professional for a prenatal checkup during your first trimester and then regularly throughout your pregnancy will drastically reduce your baby’s risks. 

The South Carolina health department also offers a free online book, “Nine Months to Get Ready,” that provides tips specific to the month of your pregnancy. Visit www.scdhec.gov/Health/FamilyPlanning/Pregnancy/ for more information.



###### Q: How do I sign up for programs to get help for me and my baby?

A: Based on your income and the county you live in, you may qualify for special programs that help promote healthy pregnancies and babies. WIC — short for “Women, Infants and Children” — is a federal program that provides food vouchers and free formula to mothers whose income falls below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, or less than $21,774 for a single pregnant woman without any other children. That income threshold increases based on family size. 

To apply for WIC, contact your local county health department.

Other programs also may help you, but some of them aren’t available in every county. For example, Nurse Family Partnership, which sends nurses into the homes of first-time, low-income pregnant women, is very reliable, effective and convenient, but it’s currently offered in only 26 South Carolina counties. Call your local county health department or ask your doctor or health care provider if the program is offered in your area. Participation is free.
