The inability of many pregnant women to pay for and get the care they need are two key reasons why babies in South Carolina keep dying.

In no place is that more true than rural pockets across the state where few doctors work and medical facilities are lacking.

To produce this series, The Post and Courier interviewed dozens of physicians, mothers, experts and health care workers, and reviewed numerous studies and reports.

From that information, possible solutions emerged to help prevent the deaths of our most vulnerable children.

PROBLEM:

Many women in rural South Carolina lack access to prenatal care.

SOLUTION:

One possible solution would be to expand an existing hospital residency program in Oconee County that trains family physicians for service in rural areas. The program provides physician residents with optional specialized training in obstetrics and some obstetrical surgeries, such as C-sections.

PROBLEM:

Many women in poor, rural areas of the state can’t afford prenatal care. And many doctors in South Carolina won’t accept Medicaid.

SOLUTION:

The state could greatly expand programs that send public health nurses to regularly visit first-time mothers to teach them about healthy nutrition, diets and behavior. 

PROBLEM:

Eight of South Carolina’s counties don’t have an obstetrician or gynecologist to serve women of child-bearing age. Many rural counties have just one such specialist.

SOLUTION:

The state could offer substantial financial incentives to persuade obstetricians and obstetrically-trained family physicians to practice in under-served communities. 

The Legislature could also continue expanding the state’s existing telemedicine program that connects rural physicians with medical specialists in Charleston and Columbia.

PROBLEM:

Obesity in women of child-bearing age can significantly increase the odds of a preterm birth. Babies in South Carolina who were born too soon or too small accounted for 20 percent of all infant mortality cases in 2013. Obesity can lead to numerous major health problems, including diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. About a third of all South Carolinians are obese. About 28 percent of whites are obese and 43 percent of blacks are obese.

SOLUTION: Accessible primary care could help reduce obesity. The state also could mount a robust public health publicity campaign to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy lifestyles and eating habits. Previous and current programs have had no apparent impact on the state’s obesity rates.

PROBLEM:

Statewide, black babies die before their first birthdays at double the rate of white babies, and in many rural counties black infants die at rates triple those of whites — rates similar to those in such impoverished third-world countries as the Philippines, Vietnam and Syria.

SOLUTION:

Make it easier and cheaper for women of child-bearing age to get preventive medical care so they are healthier before and after becoming pregnant. This can be accomplished through a major and continuing public health education initiative on the order of the anti-smoking campaign. The state also could expand the Nurse Family Partnership program to all counties. That would provide thousands more poor, first-time mothers with regular visits at home from a public health nurse during their pregnancy to receive prenatal and healthy behavior consultation.

PROBLEM

Only 9 of 19 rural hospitals continue to deliver babies as financially stressed country hospitals in general continue to lose money and scale back services. This causes many pregnant women to travel long distances to reach delivery rooms and decreases their ability to get medical care.

SOLUTION:

Some rural hospitals continue to thrive by formally linking with major hospitals or hospital chains. Major hospitals in South Carolina could beef up their rural outreach services, such as MUSC’s telemedicine program and the state’s Nurse Family Partnership program, to increase access to prenatal care.
