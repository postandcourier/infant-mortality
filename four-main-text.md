Early last year, Erin Taylor noticed redness on the cheeks of her 5-year-old son Cody when he came home from preschool.

The doctor told her Cody had contracted fifth disease, a contagious infection also known as slapped-cheek disease because that’s what it initially looks like.

It’s a mild infection, common among school-aged children. But it can be dangerous for women in the first half of their pregnancies. It increases the odds of miscarriage, and it attacks a fetus’s red blood cells and bone marrow, causing severe anemia, swelling and possible death.

A week after Cody showed his first symptoms of fifth disease, Erin broke out with the rash.

She was about three months pregnant. 

She and her husband, Scott, now 39, are devout Baptists and considered the pregnancy a gift from God because she had hemorrhaged during her pregnancy with Cody and didn’t think she could have another baby.

Now, that gift was in danger.

The couple consulted with her physician and doctors at Palmetto Health Richland hospital in Columbia, who recommended that she seek assistance from specialists at the Medical University of South Carolina.

The Taylors discovered they were about to benefit from one of the most promising new programs in the state to get specialized medical skill to rural communities and hospitals that lack necessary expertise.

MUSC is 130 miles and more than a two-hour drive from the Taylors’ home in rural Kershaw County, but they learned they would not need to travel there.

That’s because MUSC has been attempting to widen its reach, especially to areas of rural South Carolina that lack medical care and access to specialists.

MUSC has set up a series of telemedicine stations at various hospitals and clinics across much of eastern and southern South Carolina. MUSC specialists use the stations to provide real-time consultation with rural physicians who lack specialized medical training in various fields, including obstetrics.

Eight of the state’s counties have no doctors specially trained in the care of pregnant women. Many of these counties also have infant mortality rates — especially among black infants — that are double and triple the state average.

Dr. Danette McAlhaney is a family practitioner in Bamberg County. She’s one of a handful of doctors in that area who have signed on to participate in a similar Medicaid telemedicine program. It will offer specialized pregnancy and birthing consultation for women in rural pockets of the state where there aren’t any OB/GYNs, such as in Allendale, Bamberg or Hampton counties.

This way, women won’t need to drive half an hour to Orangeburg for routine medical care during their pregnancies. They can just sit in her office and connect with a remote specialist on a computer monitor.

“We’ve got a lot of people in Bamberg,” McAlhaney said. “We’re not talking about people of our social standing — Medicaid, indigent patients. Those are the people who have a hard time getting to Orangeburg.”

Back in Kershaw County, the Taylors drove 30 miles from their rural home to the hospital in Columbia. There, Dr. Scott Sullivan, an MUSC maternal medicine specialist, could talk with Erin Taylor, read her medical tests and consult with her physicians using a secure computer station mounted with a video screen and a rotatable webcam.

The contraption resembles a “Star Wars” robot.

At first, Erin, 36, felt the telemedicine would be impersonal. But Sullivan and other MUSC specialists treated her with the sensitive bedside manner of old-fashioned, country doctors. The more she thought about it, Erin said, telemedicine wasn’t much different than FaceTime on her cellphone.

Erin was 12 to 13 weeks pregnant when the telemedicine exams began. Sullivan told her that if her baby went 10 weeks without a significant increase in anemia, the danger would be over.

But at 18 weeks, the fetus grew sicker. The telemedicine monitors showed Sullivan the readings were too high and the fetus would need an in-utero blood transfusion to survive.

On May 29, Erin went to MUSC for the transfusion. At the time, no physician in Columbia was trained in the procedure. “It isn’t so much unique. It’s just hard to do,” Sullivan said. A needle must be threaded into the baby’s umbilical cord so the blood can be pushed in.

The procedure “can be quite dangerous. We lose kids sometimes during and afterward from bleeding,” Sullivan said.

The transfusion didn’t go well. The doctors were “in there twice as long as they like to be,” Erin said.

“We almost lost him twice,” Sullivan said of the then-unborn baby boy who was not cooperating by moving around too much.

Sullivan had managed to get about three-quarters of the transfusion blood into the baby’s umbilical cord when the baby kicked the needle out. Rather than try to stick the cord again, Sullivan opted to use an old trick described by the physicians who perfected the technique. He jabbed the needle into the baby’s belly, where it would take longer for the blood transfusion to be absorbed. He hoped that might prevent the need for a second transfusion. 

Doctors told Erin the next 24 hours would be high-risk while they waited to see if the baby would produce red blood cells. “We were only buying time with the transfusion,” Erin said.

She and her husband stayed that night at MUSC and cheered each time she felt the baby kick. It meant he was alive. “We celebrated the moment. It was a gift.”

The 24 hours passed with no alarm, and the couple returned to Camden where Sullivan resumed regular monitoring via telemedicine.

Two weeks after the transfusion, the baby’s vital signs returned to normal. Seventeen weeks later, on Oct. 4, Joshua was born, a healthy 6 pounds, 11 ounces.

“It was the best gift I’ve ever been given,” Erin said. “I haven’t set him down much.”
