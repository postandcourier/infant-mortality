<p class="lead drop-cap">A photo of Ashley McElveen as a baby hangs on the wall to her left as Karen Driggers places a life-sized toy baby in her arms. </p>

<p>On this February day, Ashley is 21, single and 15 weeks pregnant with her first child. She lives with her parents, holds a high school diploma and works as a clothing sales clerk at a nearby shopping mall.</p>

<p>She remains uncertain whether the father of her baby, a boyfriend of six months, has grasped what’s going on or is prepared for the new role in his life.</p>

</div>

<p>She’s typical of far too many young black mothers in a state where the death rate for black newborns runs two or three times that of whites — more in some counties. And that is one of the main reasons Driggers visits her regularly.</p>

<p>Ashley sinks into an overstuffed couch in the den of her parents’ brick ranch home in a neighborhood of tidy, small houses and trailers just off this farm town’s main drag. </p>

<p>The town claims as a favorite son Depression-era FBI agent Melvin Purvis, who famously led the hunt that killed gangster John Dillinger. Nowadays, it's best known for the nearby Honda all-terrain vehicle plant.</p>

<p>Three miles from that bustling plant, Ashley cradles the toy baby in the crook of her left arm with the ease of an experienced mother.</p>

<p>The toy baby is a prop Driggers uses to gauge how comfortable first-time mothers-to-be are with what will soon be coming their way.</p>

<p>Driggers is one of dozens of nurses in South Carolina who are part of a national program called Nurse Family Partnership. McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, where Driggers works, sponsors the program in four of the 26 mostly rural counties where it operates.</p>

<p>The four counties — Florence, Darlington, Dillon and Marlboro — are part of McLeod’s service area.</p>

<p>McLeod’s effort also receives money from the Children’s Trust of South Carolina, Boeing South Carolina and the Marlboro County General Hospital Trust Foundation.</p>

<p>McLeod sees the initiative as a way to counter the high infant mortality rates and preterm deliveries that plague Florence and the rural Pee Dee counties that surround it. The program got underway in December.</p>

<h3 id="the-cradle-of-death">The 'cradle of death'</h3>

<img class="u-img-responsive" src="images/cradle-map.png">

<p>Infant mortality is such a crisis in many counties surrounding McLeod that the area is a virtual cradle of death, with some of the state’s highest rates of newborns dying before their first birthdays — nearly double the state average.</p>

<p>For black newborns, the toll is even greater — douple or triple that of whites, and more in some cases.</p>

<p>Ashley fits the mold for the type of young mother the program aims to serve. The idea is to pair nurses with low-income, first-time moms to help them build healthy lives for themselves and their babies.</p>

<p>The nurses meet their assigned mothers at home several times every month throughout pregnancy and then after delivery until the babies turn 2 years old. </p>

<p>Ashley was referred to the program by the Florence County Health Department. Her baby is due in August.</p>

<p>Driggers visits nine mothers each week.</p>

<p>The program’s goal is 25 for each of the five nurses currently participating. The program serves 29 mothers, but that’s expected to grow rapidly.</p>

<p>Of the state’s many, but mostly scattered, uncoordinated and underfunded efforts to combat infant mortality, the Nurse Family Partnership offers a proven track record. </p>

<p>It’s a pricey, hands-on program that costs about $4,800 a year per mother. In 2014, the program served 1,286 South Carolina mothers and their babies.</p>

<p>It can cost as much as $6,500 per family, McLeod spokeswoman Tracy Stanton said. But she pointed to studies that show it works and that for every dollar spent, it earns a $6.20 return from decreased spending on health care, criminal justice, child protection and other community services.</p>

<p>A report published last year in the <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1886653" target="_blank"> medical journal JAMA Pediatrics</a> found significant reductions in infant mortality and other childhood problems as a result of nurses making regular home visits with pregnant women and young mothers. The study in Memphis, Tennessee described such visits with young mothers as “a promising means of reducing … mortality in their first-born children living in highly disadvantaged settings.”</p>

<h3>Crucial care</h3>

<p>Lack of prenatal care is a key driver of infant mortality in South Carolina, possibly the main single cause.</p>

<p>Recent state data shows that if pregnant women receive little or no prenatal care, their babies face a death risk five times higher than the state average rate.</p>
In 2013, 103 such babies died. These deaths account for 27 percent of the 389 babies who died in South Carolina that year. 

<p>Dr. Oscar Lovelace, a family physician in Newberry who has been specially trained to provide obstetrical care to pregnant women, said well-trained family physicians are a crucial building block of an adequate rural medical community.</p>

<p>“The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research has reported that the most cost-effective public health interventions are childhood immunizations and prenatal care for poor women,” Lovelace said.</p>

<p>“South Carolina is falling further behind by not understanding this.”</p>

<h3 id="family-support">Family support</h3>

<p>Ashley is lucky. She has the support of her parents who have made room for the baby.</p>

<p>She was so nervous when she learned she was pregnant that she waited to tell her father until he was talking with someone on the phone.</p>

<p>Instead of anger, he responded with calm reassurance, she said. He told her, “You’re still a baby girl, but you’ve got a big responsibility.”</p>

<p>Even with her parents’ support, Ashley feels alone, angry and ignored.</p>

<p>She welcomes Driggers’ weekly visits. “It’s good to hear different voices besides your Mom and Dad.”</p>

<p>She and Driggers giggle like girlfriends sharing secrets. They talk about healthy eating, how the baby is growing — “it’s the size of an apple now” — and chat about emotions, friends who don’t come around much anymore and whether her “baby father … is ready to have a baby by me.”</p>

<p>She wants him to participate in the sessions with Driggers, but, so far, he’s stayed away.</p>

<h3 id="the-mystery-of-black-infant-death">The mystery of black infant death</h3>

<p>Just why the national death rate for blacks runs double that for whites remains uncertain and a cause of debate.</p>

<p>Even among middle- and upper-income blacks the rate remains elevated compared to whites.</p>

<p>Experts generally agree that the cause is rooted in a combination of factors.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott Sullivan, director of the Medical University of South Carolina’s Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, pins it on three main causes: poverty, genetics and diet.</p>

<p>The poverty aspect is the most obvious cause, Sullivan said. “Poverty leads to bad outcomes.” </p>

<p>Some black patients came to the clinic with “no heat, no food, no coat, domestic violence, no transportation. They cannot get to appointments, get prescriptions and afford a healthy lifestyle,” Sullivan said.</p>

<p>“We have five full-time staff who do nothing else but help these folks, and still it is not enough,” he said.</p>

<p>Sullivan, and many experts, believe blacks also have genetic susceptibilities to environmental exposures that most others fight off with relative ease.</p>

<p>“Things like little infections, urinary tract or vaginal, can be devastating” in some black patients, he said.</p>

<p>In addition, blacks experience “higher rates of hypertension, kidney disease and diabetes, which all have a genetic component,” Sullivan said.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry Lemon, an MUSC pediatrician, said one example of how subtle genetic susceptibilities can be is the fact that darker-skinned people suffer a greater incidence of vitamin D deficiency.</p>

<p>Consequently, he said, if a pregnant black woman lacks prenatal care, she may not get the high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy that can reduce instances of diabetes, preterm birth and infection.</p>

<p>Obesity caused by an unhealthy diet and lifestyle is Sullivan’s third cause of high black infant mortality.</p>

<p>“Obesity is associated with almost every kind of complication — including fetal, neonatal and infant death,” Sullivan said. “It’s an absolute epidemic. We see 300-, 400-, 600-pound patients.</p>

<p>“We do all we can do, which is a lot, but it’s a daunting task. They have more birth defects, more preterm birth, more neonatal medical complications — all leading causes of infant death.</p>

<p>“Part of that comes back to poverty: Good food is expensive and carbs are cheap. I see 300-pound patients with no iron, no vitamin D, no folate, no B-12 and low protein, literally starving in a large body,” Sullivan said.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, two-thirds of the residents are overweight or obese. That means the state as a whole is generally unhealthy because excess weight and obesity contribute to numerous chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.</p>

<p>For black South Carolinians, the numbers are bleaker. Two out of every five blacks are obese compared to about one in four of whites.</p>

<p>And then, less tangible factors come into play.</p>

<p>An increasing number of studies, including some cited by the National Institutes of Health, theorize that the cumulative level of stress from dealing with real and perceived racism takes a health toll on blacks and may account for part of the high infant mortality rate.</p>

<p>Other studies contradict that by pointing out that Hispanics in the U.S. have an infant mortality rate on par with whites, yet they, like blacks, deal with discrimination.</p>

<p>Still other studies point to the added stresses some black women face in everyday life — broken families, poverty, single motherhood, lack of health care, lack of education and crime.</p>

<p>When it comes to pinpointing why blacks suffer markedly higher rates of infant mortality, Sullivan said, “there’s a lot we don’t understand.”</p>

<h3>Building a baby-friendly lifestyle</h3>

<p>Ashley continues to cradle the toy baby in her left arm and gestures with her right hand toward nurse Driggers.</p>

<p>“She’s like having another mom I can learn a lot more from,” Ashley says.</p>

<p>“I was not prepared at all,” when Driggers’ visits began, Ashley said. “Now, I can have someone to talk to and break things down. You can’t get it from a doctor.”</p>

<p>For Driggers, the goal is to develop long-term relationships with young mothers to steadily break the cycle that can lead to preventable infant deaths.</p>

<p>“We’re here to set life goals” that set mothers on the path to healthy lives for themselves and their children, and the family and friends they touch, Driggers says.</p>

<p>She turns toward Ashley. “Look how far you’ve come.”</p>

<p>Ashley replies, “I think I’ll be a good mother. I’ve kind of got it down.”</p>
