<p class="lead drop-cap">Early last year, Erin Taylor noticed redness on the cheeks of her 5-year-old son Cody when he came home from preschool.</p>

<p>The doctor told her Cody had contracted fifth disease, a contagious infection also known as slapped-cheek disease because that’s what it initially looks like.</p>

<p>It’s a mild infection, common among school-aged children. But it can be dangerous for women in the first half of their pregnancies. It increases the odds of miscarriage, and it attacks a fetus’s red blood cells and bone marrow, causing severe anemia, swelling and possible death.</p>

<p>A week after Cody showed his first symptoms of fifth disease, Erin broke out with the rash.</p>

<div class="pull-image u-pull-left">

  <div class="small-image-caption"><span class="image-caption grey-highlight">Erin and Scott Taylor with their infant son in their Camden home. <span class="photo-credit">Wade Spees/Staff</span></span></div>
</div>

<p>She was about three months pregnant. </p>

<p>She and her husband, Scott, now 39, are devout Baptists and considered the pregnancy a gift from God because she had hemorrhaged during her pregnancy with Cody and didn’t think she could have another baby.</p>

<p>Now, that gift was in danger.</p>

<p>The couple consulted with her physician and doctors at Palmetto Health Richland hospital in Columbia. They recommended she seek assistance from specialists at the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Taylors discovered they were about to benefit from one of the most promising new programs in the state to get specialized medical skill to rural communities and hospitals that lack necessary expertise.</p>

<p>MUSC is 130 miles and more than a two-hour drive from the Taylors’ home in rural Kershaw County, but they learned they would not need to travel there.</p>

<p>That’s because MUSC has been attempting to widen its reach, especially to areas of rural South Carolina that lack medical care and access to specialists.</p>

<p>MUSC has set up a series of telemedicine stations at various hospitals and clinics across much of rural South Carolina. Hospital specialists use the stations to provide real-time consultation with rural physicians who lack specialized medical training in various fields, including obstetrics.</p>

<p>Eight of the state’s counties have no doctors specially trained in the care of pregnant women. Many of these counties also have infant mortality rates — especially among black infants — that are double and triple the state average.</p>

<p>Dr. Danette McAlhaney is a family practitioner in Bamberg County. She’s one of a handful of doctors in that area who have signed on to participate in a similar Medicaid telemedicine program. It will offer specialized pregnancy and birthing consultation for women in rural pockets of the state where there aren’t any OB/GYNs, such as in Allendale, Bamberg or Hampton counties.</p>

<p>This way, women won’t need to drive half an hour to Orangeburg for routine medical care during their pregnancies. They can just sit in her office and connect with a remote specialist on a computer monitor.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a lot of people in Bamberg,” McAlhaney said. “We’re not talking about people of our social standing — Medicaid, indigent patients. Those are the people who have a hard time getting to Orangeburg.”</p>

<p>Back in Kershaw County, the Taylors drove 30 miles from their rural home to the hospital in Columbia. There, Dr. Scott Sullivan, an MUSC maternal medicine specialist, could talk with Erin Taylor, read her medical tests and consult with her physicians using a secure computer station mounted with a video screen and a rotatable webcam.</p>

<p>The contraption resembles a “Star Wars” robot.</p>

<div class="pull-image u-pull-left">

  <div class="small-image-caption"><span class="image-caption grey-highlight">Tears of emotion — and joy — still come to Erin Taylor while talking about her infant son as she nurses him. She and her husband Scott benefited from health care far from their Camden  home, including telemedicine meetings with an MUSC physician. <span class="photo-credit">Wade Spees/Staff</span></span></div>
</div>

<p>At first, Erin, 36, felt the telemedicine would be impersonal. But Sullivan and other MUSC specialists treated her with the sensitive bedside manner of old-fashioned, country doctors. The more she thought about it, Erin said, telemedicine wasn’t much different than FaceTime on her cellphone.</p>

<p>Erin was 12 to 13 weeks pregnant when the telemedicine exams began. Sullivan told her that if her baby went 10 weeks without a significant increase in anemia, the danger would be over.</p>

<p>But at 18 weeks, the fetus grew sicker. The telemedicine monitors showed Sullivan the readings were too high and the fetus would need an in-utero blood transfusion to survive.</p>

<p>On May 29, Erin went to MUSC for the transfusion. At the time, no physician in Columbia was trained in the procedure. “It isn’t so much unique. It’s just hard to do,” Sullivan said. A needle must be threaded into the baby’s umbilical cord so the blood can be pushed in.</p>

<p>The procedure “can be quite dangerous. We lose kids sometimes during and afterward from bleeding,” Sullivan said.</p>

<p>The transfusion didn’t go well. The doctors were “in there twice as long as they like to be,” Erin said.</p>

<p>“We almost lost him twice,” Sullivan said of the then-unborn baby boy who was not cooperating by moving around too much.</p>

<p>Sullivan had managed to get about three-quarters of the transfusion blood into the baby’s umbilical cord when the baby kicked the needle out. Rather than try to stick the cord again, Sullivan opted to use an old trick described by the physicians who perfected the technique. He jabbed the needle into the baby’s belly, where it would take longer for the blood transfusion to be absorbed. He hoped that might prevent the need for a second transfusion. </p>

<p>Doctors told Erin the next 24 hours would be high-risk while they waited to see if the baby would produce red blood cells. “We were only buying time with the transfusion,” Erin said.</p>

<p>She and her husband stayed that night at MUSC and cheered each time she felt the baby kick. It meant he was alive. “We celebrated the moment. It was a gift.”</p>

<p>The 24 hours passed with no alarm, and the couple returned to Camden where Sullivan resumed regular monitoring via telemedicine.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the transfusion, the baby’s vital signs returned to normal. Seventeen weeks later, on Oct. 4, Joshua was born, a healthy 6 pounds, 11 ounces.</p>

<p>“It was the best gift I’ve ever been given,” Erin said. “I haven’t set him down much.”</p>

<p>The inability of many pregnant women to pay for and get the care they need are two key reasons why babies in South Carolina keep dying.</p>

<p>In no place is that more true than rural pockets across the state where few doctors work and medical facilities are lacking.</p>

<p>To produce this series, The Post and Courier interviewed dozens of physicians, mothers, experts and health care workers, and reviewed numerous studies and reports.</p>

<p>From that information, possible solutions emerged to help prevent the deaths of our most vulnerable children.</p>


<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>PROBLEM</h6>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Many women in rural South Carolina lack access to prenatal care.</span></p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>SOLUTION</h6>

<p>One possible solution would be to expand an existing hospital residency program in Oconee County that trains family physicians for service in rural areas. The program provides physician residents with optional specialized training in obstetrics and some obstetrical surgeries, such as C-sections.</p>

<p>The state could also offer full scholarships to medical school to physicians who contract to practice for a specified number of years in selected, under-served communities in South Carolina.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>PROBLEM</h6>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Many women in poor, rural areas of the state can’t afford prenatal care.</span> And many doctors in South Carolina won’t accept Medicaid.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>SOLUTION</h6>

<p>The state could greatly expand programs that send public health nurses to regularly visit first-time mothers to teach them about healthy nutrition, diets and behavior. </p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>PROBLEM</h6>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Eight of South Carolina’s counties don’t have an obstetrician or gynecologist to serve women of child-bearing age.</span> Many rural counties have just one such specialist.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>SOLUTION</h6>

<p>The state could offer substantial financial incentives to persuade obstetricians and obstetrically-trained family physicians to practice in under-served communities. </p>

<p>The Legislature could also continue expanding the state’s existing telemedicine program that connects rural physicians with medical specialists in Charleston and Columbia.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>PROBLEM</h6>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Obesity in women of child-bearing age can significantly increase the odds of a preterm birth.</span> Babies in South Carolina who were born too soon or too small accounted for 20 percent of all infant mortality cases in 2013. Obesity can lead to numerous major health problems, including diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. About a third of all South Carolinians are obese. About 28 percent of whites are obese and 43 percent of blacks are obese.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">
    
<h6>Solution</h6>

<p>Accessible primary care could help reduce obesity. The state also could mount a robust public health publicity campaign to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy lifestyles and eating habits. Previous and current programs have had no apparent impact on the state’s obesity rates.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>PROBLEM</h6>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Statewide, black babies die before their first birthdays at double the rate of white babies,</span> and in many rural counties black infants die at rates triple those of whites — rates similar to those in such impoverished third-world countries as the Philippines, Vietnam and Syria.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>SOLUTION</h6>

<p>Make it easier and cheaper for women of child-bearing age to get preventive medical care so they are healthier before and after becoming pregnant. This can be accomplished through a major and continuing public health education initiative on the order of the anti-smoking campaign. The state also could expand the Nurse Family Partnership program to all counties. That would provide thousands more poor, first-time mothers with regular visits at home from a public health nurse during their pregnancy to receive prenatal and healthy behavior consultation.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="six columns">

<p>PROBLEM</p>

<p><span class="red-highlight">Only 9 of 19 rural hospitals continue to deliver babies as financially stressed country hospitals in general continue to lose money and scale back services.</span> This causes many pregnant women to travel long distances to reach delivery rooms and decreases their ability to get medical care.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="six columns">

<h6>SOLUTION</h6>

<p>Some rural hospitals continue to thrive by formally linking with major hospitals or hospital chains. Major hospitals in South Carolina could beef up their rural outreach services, such as MUSC’s telemedicine program and the state’s Nurse Family Partnership program, to increase access to prenatal care.</p>

<h5 id="q-i-just-found-out-im-pregnant-but-i-dont-have-health-insurance-what-do-i-do">Q: I just found out I’m pregnant, but I don’t have health insurance. What do I do?</h5>

<p>A: Depending on your income, you might qualify for Medicaid coverage. The easiest way to check is to call 888-549-0820 or go to the agency’s online application, <a href="https://apply.scdhhs.gov/CitizenPortal/logon.jsp" target="_blank"> apply.scdhhs.gov</a>. </p>

<p>Even if you already have health insurance, depending on your income, you may qualify for Medicaid as secondary coverage. In that case, Medicaid could help cover some of the out-of-pocket expenses not covered by private insurance. </p>

<p>Even if you’re not sure if you qualify, don’t hesitate to call a doctor or hospital and set up your first appointment. If your application is approved, Medicaid will retroactively cover your prenatal medical bills even if it takes some time to do your paperwork. </p>

<p>If you make too much money for Medicaid, look at the answer to the next question.</p>

<h5 id="q-ive-been-denied-medicaid-coverage-and-im-pregnant-how-can-i-afford-prenatal-care">Q: I’ve been denied Medicaid coverage and I’m pregnant. How can I afford prenatal care?</h5>

<p>A: First, consider private health insurance. An insurance agent or broker can help you consider your options. </p>

<p>Insurance navigators at The Palmetto Project, 843-577-4122, may also help. This nonprofit group has been trained by the federal government to help customers enroll in coverage. Their services are free.</p>

<p>If you can’t afford private insurance, you still need to make an appointment to see a doctor or a health care professional. Try calling a local health center, such as the federally subsidized <a href="https://fetterhealthcare.org/#medicaid-eligibility-worker" target="_blank"> Fetter Health Network</a> in Charleston County. Similar federally funded, low-income clinics are <a href="http://schealthdata.org/map/fqhc/2012/" target="_blank"> located across the state</a>. They offer health care services to uninsured patients and charge discounted, flat fees, which are calculated based on your income. </p>

<p>Call the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association, 803-788-2778, or go to the association’s website, <a href="http://www.scphca.org/" target="_blank"> www.scphca.org</a>, to find a health center near you. </p>

<h5 id="q-i-dont-have-a-car-how-do-i-get-to-the-doctors-office">Q: I don’t have a car. How do I get to the doctor’s office?</h5>

<p>A: If you’re covered by Medicaid, you can get a ride to your appointments, but you need to call Logisticare, 866-445-9954, at least three days in advance of your next office visit. </p>

<p>If you’re not covered by Medicaid, you might consider seeing a doctor whose office can be easily reached by public transportation. For example, both the MUSC Women’s Care clinic in North Charleston and the Fetter Health Network on the peninsula are within short walking distance of public bus lines.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing some medical emergency, call 911 for an ambulance. </p>

<h5 id="q-theres-no-doctor-or-hospital-in-the-county-i-live-in-that-delivers-babies-where-do-i-go">Q: There’s no doctor or hospital in the county I live in that delivers babies. Where do I go?</h5>

<p>A: It’s very possible that you live in a county that offers no obstetrical services. Even if you do live near a hospital, some of them, especially in rural areas, don’t deliver babies anymore. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, find the location of your closest hospital. Call the hospital or a doctor’s office for advice. You may also consider using a licensed midwife to handle delivery at home or at a birth center if your pregnancy is uncomplicated. Go to the state health department’s website, <a href="http://www.scdhec.gov/Health/FHPF/HealthFacilityRegulationsLicensing/HealthcareFacilityLicensing/FacilitySpecificInfo/Midwives/" target="_blank">www.scdhec.gov</a>, for more information. </p>

<p>If you’re going to need to travel a significant distance to deliver your baby, make sure you’re ready ahead of time. Arrange for transportation and pack a bag for your hospital stay in advance.</p>

<h5 id="q-what-can-i-do-to-give-my-baby-the-best-chance-of-being-healthy">Q: What can I do to give my baby the best chance of being healthy?</h5>

<p>A: Find a doctor who offers prenatal medical care. Seeing a health care professional for a prenatal checkup during your first trimester and then regularly throughout your pregnancy will drastically reduce your baby’s risks. </p>

<p>The South Carolina health department also offers a free online book, “Nine Months to Get Ready,” that provides tips specific to the month of your pregnancy. Go to <a href="http://www.scdhec.gov/Health/FamilyPlanning/Pregnancy/" target="_blank">www.scdhec.gov/Health/FamilyPlanning/Pregnancy/</a> for more information.</p>

<h5 id="q-how-do-i-sign-up-for-programs-to-get-help-for-me-and-my-baby">Q: How do I sign up for programs to get help for me and my baby?</h5>

<p>A: Based on your income and the county you live in, you may qualify for special programs that help promote healthy pregnancies and babies. WIC, short for “Women, Infants and Children,” is a federal program that provides food vouchers and free formula to mothers whose income falls below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, or less than $21,774 for a single pregnant woman without any other children. That income threshold increases based on family size. </p>

<p>To apply for WIC, contact your local county health department.</p>

<p>Other programs also may help you, but some of them aren’t available in every county. For example, Nurse Family Partnership, which sends nurses into the homes of first-time, low-income pregnant women, is very reliable, effective and convenient, but it’s currently offered in only 26 South Carolina counties. Call your local county health department or ask your doctor or health care provider if the program is offered in your area. Participation is free.</p>
