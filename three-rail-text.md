The sound of her baby’s heartbeat comforted Laura Quamme, but a lingering question haunted her as she entered the final months of her first pregnancy.

“Why didn’t he move more?”

Her doctor reassured her that the baby was just very calm.

The new mother-to-be assumed all was fine when she mistook cramps or contractions for baby kicks.

Then, she swelled with excessive fluid.

That, too, wasn’t normal.

She didn’t learn something was very wrong until after she went for an ultrasound and was promptly sent to Trident Medical Center in North Charleston.

There, technicians hooked her to monitors but said nothing about her baby. They told her she was having contractions with two months to go until her due date. Then, they transferred her to the specialized care at MUSC’s Maternal Fetal Medicine department. 

It was March 2010, and her due date wasn’t until May.

At MUSC, Laura received a high-powered ultrasound to help doctors get a better look at what was going on.

One of the physicians told her the baby showed no signs of moving and no signs of breathing.

The only sign of life was his heartbeat.

The doctor then said, “I’m sorry, but we don’t think the baby will survive after birth.”

Laura gasped. She was stunned, feeling blindsided. None of her previous doctors had even hinted death was a possibility for the baby she would name Noah.

The MUSC physician was surprised Laura hadn’t been told earlier.

“He thought we knew,” Laura said. 

He tried reassuring her that there’s always hope. But Laura’s mind blurred. She found herself enveloped in “a whole horrible feeling of despair.”

“How could this be?” she wondered. “Kids don’t die nowadays!”

### Nothing to do but wait

Neither she nor her doctors could do anything but wait for Noah’s birth.

Laura covered her head as she walked from the examination room, not wanting to make eye contact with passersby who might ask about the baby she so obviously carried.

Noah didn’t wait for his due date. He was born prematurely on March 25, 2010. 

MUSC neonatal specialists stood by to do what they could to save Noah. As soon as he was born, they rushed off with him. 

A short time later, a doctor returned and whispered, “I’m sorry.”

Noah died moments after he was born.

An autopsy revealed he had a rare birth defect — believed to be genetic — that did not allow him to breathe, or move. His  peripheral nervous system, the nerves outside the brain and spinal column, basically did not work.

Dr. Scott Sullivan, director of MUSC’s Maternal Fetal Medicine, researched the case.

He found only one other instance that occurred in Paris in the 1970s.

Sullivan and his team set about trying to understand how the defect worked on the baby’s body and the genetics. They wanted to be able to tell Laura what risks she faced in a future pregnancy.

They pinpointed the indicators and determined what to look for by ultrasound, Sullivan said.

The physicians believed Laura likely had a 1-in-4  chance of the same thing happening again.

Some newborn deaths are simply unavoidable.

But, Sullivan had a theory that the defect “might not manifest in the same way each time. There would be a chance that another child would be partially affected, and we could do something to help.”

If it occurred in exactly the same way, Sullivan said, “all we could do would be to plan and do palliative — like hospice — care.

Laura and her husband, Andrew, now a Boeing engineer, buried Noah in Magnolia Cemetery over Easter weekend.

On Easter day, Laura felt an overwhelming reassurance “like God is going to bless us with a lot of children. That’s when the spark of hope happened.”

Fourteen months later, Laura, now 33, gave birth to William.

In short order, he was followed by two more healthy children, Anna in 2013 and Jillian, “perfect and beautiful,” just last week.

Sullivan and his department’s specialists monitored each of the pregnancies.

Laura remembers the thrill that rushed over her when William moved and punched inside her.

“I said to myself, ‘So this is what it feels like to have a baby kick.’”
