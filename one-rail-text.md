Lucy lies on a hospital bed about to give birth prematurely. She breathes heavily, her heart races and she screams in pain as her baby slips between her legs into waiting hands.

Lucy is a sophisticated, lifelike dummy. She has been programmed to mimic many birth problems in a mobile lab that travels the state to train medical professionals in lifesaving procedures.

Lucy and her roaming lab were paid for with private donations to the Palmetto Health-University of South Carolina School of Medicine. Lucy is just one of many efforts underway in South Carolina to improve infant health.

Most of these programs stem from the Birth Outcomes Initiative, founded four years ago by the former director of the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. 
The initiative and some of the other efforts likely played some role in the state’s recently reduced rate of newborn deaths. 

Some of the programs aren’t available in every South Carolina county, and the state has made minimal financial investment in the efforts. Most are paid for almost entirely by the federal government and grants from nonprofits.

They include:

##### Mother’s Milk Bank of South Carolina
Severely premature babies are more likely to die if they’re given infant formula instead of breast milk.

A human milk bank can fill this need when a mother can’t produce milk or can’t produce enough for her baby.

But South Carolina hasn’t had its own milk bank. Because of that, the Medical University of South Carolina has historically shipped human breast milk from a milk bank in Austin, Texas.

This year, an MUSC doctor is launching the state’s first nonprofit milk bank to ensure that premature infants in neonatal intensive care units at the state’s major medical centers have access to a reliable supply of human breast milk at a lower cost. The bank has been built with about $200,000 in donations from several organizations, including the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina Foundation.

##### 39-week initiative

Infants typically need to grow for 40 weeks in their mother’s womb before they are born, but doctors have routinely scheduled early inductions or C-sections for their convenience or at the patients’ request. 

Research shows that inducing delivery before 39 weeks may be dangerous for infants, but it still happens.

That’s why, in 2013, the South Carolina Medicaid agency and BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina stopped paying for deliveries before 39 weeks unless the physician could offer a valid medical reason for early delivery. 

Between early 2011 and 2013, the percentage of elective inductions in South Carolina dropped by half, according to a report published last year. 

##### Supporting vaginal birth

An increasing number of C-sections over the past 20 years have been performed for convenience or out of an abundance of caution by doctors who fear medical malpractice lawsuits. 

The state Medicaid agency wants doctors to become more comfortable allowing mothers to labor longer before resorting to a C-section delivery. They are doing so because the agency pays for 56 percent of all deliveries in South Carolina every year.

C-sections are associated with higher health care costs. Eventually, Medicaid leaders have indicated they will change the way the agency pays hospitals for delivering babies in an effort to further reduce the C-section rate.

##### Centering Pregnancy

This program offers group prenatal support. Women who are expecting infants, including those insured by the low-income Medicaid program, may sign up for one of these groups that meet regularly before delivery.

Moms learn tips from health care professionals, form bonds with each other and share their own experiences.

One study shows that women in group care, particularly black women, are less likely to deliver premature babies than women who don’t receive such care.

Centering Pregnancy is not yet available in every county. 

##### Nurse Family Partnership

This national program has earned much recognition for improving infant health by pairing nurses with first-time, low-income moms who need help. Nurses meet their assigned mothers at home several times each month throughout pregnancy, and then after delivery until their babies turn 2 years old. 

The program is expensive, but evidence shows it works, according to three randomized, controlled trials. Fewer babies born into Nurse Family Partnership families are premature or need treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit. The program currently is available in 26 of South Carolina’s 46 counties. 

It’s financed by federal funds and private grant money, with minimal state money. 

##### 17-Hydroxyprogesterone

These injections, sold under the brand name Makena, may be given to pregnant women who previously have given birth to premature infants. The shots are considered an effective way to prevent the mother’s next baby from being born too early. 

The list price for the brand-name version of this drug is $690 for each weekly injection. A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical company that sells the drug said commercially insured patients typically pay about $10 out of pocket per injection and Medicaid patients pay nothing. That doesn’t mean the drug is free for insurance companies or state Medicaid programs. 

In South Carolina, the Medicaid agency spent more than $500,000 on brand-name and compounded versions of this drug during a six-month span in 2014. One of the primary goals of the Birth Outcomes Initiative has been to make the drug “available to all at-risk pregnant women with no ‘hassle factor.’”

##### 'Baby Friendly'

In 2013, the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services launched a campaign called “Race to the Date” to encourage birthing hospitals to become “Baby Friendly,” a national program that promotes breastfeeding. 

Hospital nurses must undergo extensive training and cannot offer new moms the option of feeding their infants formula unless it is medically necessary.

Four hospitals, including Roper St. Francis Mt. Pleasant Hospital and Medical University Hospital, each earned $200,000 from the state government for successfully achieving the recognition by the fall 2013 deadline. Since then, three other South Carolina hospitals also have earned the “Baby Friendly” designation. The vast majority of facilities in this state that deliver babies have not been certified. Research shows breastfeeding lowers the risk for disease and promotes infant health. It also costs nothing for a mother to breastfeed her baby.

##### Healthy Connections Checkup

South Carolina did not expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. But, last year, the agency did revamp an existing family-planning program that now provides a primary care checkup and preventive screenings once every two years for low-income adults. This program does not pay for any follow-up care.
But critics argue this program, called Healthy Connections Checkup, is inadequate and the full Medicaid expansion would provide more comprehensive benefits for about 350,000 low-income South Carolinians.

Nevertheless, the program could be valuable for women in their child-bearing years. Many such women qualify for full Medicaid coverage only when they become pregnant. Experts say medical care before pregnancy and between pregnancies is vital for women who want to deliver healthy children.
It costs the state about $300 per person to administer Healthy Connections Checkup each year, compared to about $3,000 per person enrolled in regular Medicaid. Most of this cost is covered by the federal government. 

##### SBIRT

Short for “Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment,” the SBIRT test was conceived by the state Medicaid agency in 2011. It’s designed so doctors can identify pregnant women who need help with a variety of issues, including alcoholism, substance abuse and domestic violence. 

The state pays providers a small fee for each SBIRT test they administer, but the industry has been slow to catch on. Recent data provided by the state shows that Medicaid paid for 31,038 deliveries in 2013, but only 7,953 SBIRT screenings.

That means many pregnant women who need help with these issues, which may be harming their unborn babies, have not been referred to treatment. That’s because doctors and nurses across South Carolina haven’t consistently asked the women about their personal problems.

##### Telemedicine

The state Legislature has invested millions of dollars, and is expected to invest millions more this year, to build up South Carolina’s telemedicine network, which connects medical specialists with doctors in rural and underserved areas.

Improving access to specialized prenatal care is one of the many services the telemedicine system provides with computerized, videoconferencing equipment.
It is not perfect. Telemedicine is only available in select counties and some providers say they’re still confused about how they will be paid for delivering this care remotely.
