<p class="lead drop-cap">Three things stand out about Yazmin Garcia as she lies on an examination table at the Oconee County Health Department: her smile, the Mexican flags painted on each of her big toenails and her fully exposed, six-month-pregnant belly.</p>

<p>She’s here for an ultrasound to see if all looks right with her baby, which obviously is a boy.</p>

</div>

<p>She’s 22, poor, illegal, unmarried and soon to be the mother of four.</p>

<p>She’s the definition of why rural South Carolina continues to see infant mortality rates at third-world levels.</p>

<p>She’s also an example of one of the solutions to the state’s high rate of newborn deaths in rural communities.</p>

<p>Oconee is in the farthest west corner of the state. Its rolling hills butt dramatically into the Blue Ridge Mountains, cleaving deep valleys, plunging waterfalls and pristine lakes.</p>

<p>By all measures, Oconee is about as country as you can get. It should share the grim reality that plagues most of South Carolina’s rural counties: an infant mortality rate that rivals undeveloped nations.</p>

<p>But something different is at play in Oconee, home to 75,045 people. The county’s infant death rate over the past three years averaged well below the state rate, even below the national rate.</p>

<h3 id="whats-going-on">What’s going on?</h3>

<p>For years, Oconee’s infant mortality rate generally has hovered below the state average. That’s partially due to its small percentage of black residents, about eight out of every 100 residents. Only neighboring Pickens County has a smaller percentage of blacks.</p>

<p>On average for the last three years, black infant mortality in South Carolina has run at double the rate for whites. In some counties, it’s triple.</p>

<p>Another key reason for Oconee’s low infant death rate is Dr. Jennifer Hanke, and physicians like her. She’s a family doctor specially trained in obstetrics to care for women during pregnancy and childbirth. She also is trained to perform certain obstetric surgeries, mainly cesarean deliveries, or C-sections, the delivery of a baby through surgical incision.</p>

<p>She received that training during her family medicine residency just 10 miles away at Oconee Medical Center through a program designed to train family physicians for rural medical practices.</p>

<p>It’s the only such residency for family physicians in the state, one of just 25 nationally, according to the residency’s director, Dr. Ed Evans.</p>

<p>Evans, a professor of family medicine with the Medical University of South Carolina, thinks the residency helps provide one of the key means to reduce infant mortality in rural areas.</p>

<p>For the medical residents who are interested, it also offers concentrated training in obstetrical and gynecological medical service, Evans said.</p>

<p>“If you train them in an ivory tower setting,” such as in modern urban hospitals, “those people don’t stick," he said. "It’s hard for them to adjust to practicing in a rural community away from all the medical support in big cities.”</p>

<h3 id="rural-care-not-met">Rural care not met</h3>

<p>The need for doctors to care for pregnant women and newborns is high in rural South Carolina, but it’s not being met by current methods, Evans said.</p>

<p>In many rural areas, “obstetrics falls into the laps of family physicians because you just can’t get OB/GYNs to locate in tiny towns,” he said.</p>

<p>Most of those family physicians do not have specialized training to care for pregnant women and provide surgeries such as C-sections.  </p>

<p>Hanke graduated from Evans’ three-year residency in 2008, and stayed on in Oconee County because she likes small towns and the personal nature of family medicine.</p>

<p>“We’re serving a need,” she said, and rolls the ultrasound around Garcia’s belly.</p>

<p>Garcia receives ultrasounds and other prenatal care at a free clinic for undocumented Hispanics offered through the family medicine residency program. She doesn't quality for the low-income Medicaid program, as do most pregnant women, because she is undocumented. </p>

<p>The residents essentially provide free medical care in exchange for the experience, Evans said.</p>

<p>Hanke rubs more lubricating gel over Garcia’s belly and gently moves the ultrasound wand back and forth. The baby’s cellophane silhouette appears on the screen.</p>

<p>This is what Garcia’s 3-year-old son Bryan came for. He strains to look at the ultrasound screen. A smile bursts across his face. He bounces up and down and repeatedly shouts, “See the baby! See the baby! See the baby!” </p>

<p>Hanke points to the baby’s chest. She tells Garcia, “there’s the heart beating, and there you can tell its four chambers.” Bryan excitedly calls out again, “See the baby! See the baby!”</p>

<p>The only noticeable potential problem is the baby’s head pointing up instead of down as it should be for birth. But Hanke tells Garcia the baby has plenty of time left in the womb to turn around. “We’ll keep a watch on that.” </p>

<p>The ultrasound is just part of the array of prenatal services Garcia receives for free at the clinic.</p>

<h3 id="clinic-provides-whats-messing">Clinic provides what’s messing</h3>

<p>The clinic’s care stands in stark contrast to the lack of medical attention for so many other poor women across rural South Carolina.</p>

<p>It’s one reason why Oconee County’s infant mortality rate has remained substantially below the state average since the program began in 2001. </p>

<p>In the three years before the program, the county’s newborn death rate more closely mirrored the state rate.</p>

<p>Garcia painfully remembers what can happen without prenatal care.</p>

<p>In April 2013, she lost a baby just moments after birth, a death that likely would have been prevented had she come to the clinic during the early weeks of her pregnancy. </p>

<p>But the critical early weeks of her pregnancy passed with no prenatal care. She didn’t take folic acid supplements that provide extra vitamin B to head off major birth defects, especially to the brain and spine. </p>

<p>It was too late for her baby by the time she went to the clinic. Doctors had to tell her the baby would not survive after birth.</p>

<p>So Garcia was taking no chances with this pregnancy. That’s part of the reason Hanke became a family physician. “I’m into preventative medicine,” she said.</p>

<p>Hanke knows family physicians, especially those in rural practices, don’t earn as much on average per year as OB/GYNs, $176,000 compared to  $234,000.</p>

<p>For Hanke, it’s not about the money. Family medicine gives her the opportunity to handle all kinds of health problems and help people their entire lives.</p>

<p>“I like smaller towns. I love it. It’s a great place to raise a family.”</p>

<h3 id="rural-family-doctors-needed">Rural family doctors needed</h3>

<p>Hanke is the kind of doctor Evans looks for when he accepts a new resident into his program at Oconee Medical Center.</p>

<p>The program does not require resident doctors to take specialized training in obstetrics. Instead the residency is designed to encourage family physicians to open rural practices whether or not they want to practice obstetrics.</p>

<p>At any one time, seven to eight physicians are enrolled in the residency.</p>

<p>Of the 29 physicians who have graduated from it since 2003, 15 stayed in South Carolina, 12 of those in rural or underserved areas. Three of the 12 do obstetrics. Two other perform obstetrics in rural North Carolina.</p>

<p>Evans said he’s happy with the retention rate, and hopes to see similar residencies set up across South Carolina to address the lack of rural medical care.</p>

<p>The obstetrics graduates practice in three South Carolina rural counties: Oconee, Newberry and Saluda.</p>

<p>Residents who don’t want to do obstetrics in their practice still must perform a minimum amount of training in the field, Evans said.</p>

<p>“They need to have enough experience to be comfortable handling medical problems that may arise in pregnant patients.”</p>

<p>Adrianne Westmoreland is one of those specially trained family physicians who elected to remain in Oconee County. </p>

<p>She completed her residency last June and by early October she sat in front of a computer in her scrubs at Oconee Medical Center. She has just finished her first C-section since her residency.</p>

<p>“This is exciting stuff,” Westmoreland said. “You are in the action. You get to do absolutely everything.” </p>

<p>If she had stayed in` Greenville with its expansive hospital, she wouldn’t have been able to do obstetrics, much less C-sections, she said.</p>

<p>In Oconee, she handles all types of medical issues, never knowing what’s coming next. “I absolutely love not knowing what’s behind the door.”</p>

<h3 id="infant-deaths-fall-in-newberry-county">Infant deaths fall in Newberry County</h3>

<p>The Oconee County family medicine residency initially was supposed to operate in more centrally located Newberry County, just north of Columbia. That’s where family doctor Oscar Lovelace pioneered a short-lived program to give rural doctors training to perform surgical childbirth and other specialized care for pregnant women and newborns.</p>

<p>But the residency was moved to Oconee County after details could not be worked out with a sponsoring hospital in Columbia.</p>

<p>Lovelace, a family doctor, recognized the need for C-section training in 1989 during his second year of solo practice in Newberry County.</p>

<p>That year, the county’s only OB/GYN died suddenly, leaving Lovelace as the only physician delivering babies in three neighboring rural counties: Newberry, Saluda and Fairfield. He delivered 220 babies that year.</p>

<p>With no resident OB/GYN, the hospital considered stopping baby deliveries, but Lovelace urged the hospital to continue the service. He received backup from a general surgeon, but the surgeon quit medical practice in 1991.</p>

<p>A year later, Lovelace asked the Medical University of South Carolina to train him and some of the other family doctors in his practice to perform C-sections.</p>

<p>MUSC dropped the program without explanation after Lovelace completed it and before a second doctor from his practice could receive the training.</p>

<p>Lovelace blames an OB/GYN with influence on the MUSC board who didn’t want family physicians intruding in the medical specialty of obstetrics. </p>

<p>Hospital spokeswoman Heather Woolwine said MUSC halted the program because Lovelace and other family physicians were supposed to limit C-sections to emergencies.</p>

<p>Lovelace denied that. He said he helped design the program and it never was intended solely for emergency surgeries. He accused MUSC of having “turned their back on rural South Carolina.”</p>

<p>The family physicians in his practice eventually found the training at other hospitals.</p>

<h3 id="rural-medical-care-lacking">Rural medical care lacking</h3>

<p>Lovelace’s family practice became one of the few in rural South Carolina to offer full prenatal, delivery and after-care to rural, poor women who might otherwise go without. </p>

<p>Three years after Lovelace and his fellow doctors received the training, black infant mortality in Newberry County dropped by two-thirds, state health department data shows.</p>

<p>And over the last three years of complete records, rural Newberry and Oconee counties boast among the lowest overall infant mortality rates in the state — rates below the state average for that same period.</p>

<p>Unlike in Oconee County, Newberry’s low infant mortality rate of about six babies out of every 1,000 over the past three years cannot be attributed to a small black population. Blacks account for almost one-third of Newberry’s residents.</p>

<p>Lovelace was named the <a href="http://www.aafp.org/media-center/releases-statements/all/2014/lovelace-family-physician-of-the-year.html" target="_blank"> 2015 Family Physician of the Year</a> by the American Academy of Family Physicians, and said “well-trained family physicians are a keystone of the rural medical community.”</p>

<p>He cited a report by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research that identified childhood immunizations and prenatal care for poor women as the most cost-effective public health interventions.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any sense that our infant mortality rate is as high as many third-world countries,” Lovelace said.</p>

<p>The sound of her baby’s heartbeat comforted Laura Quamme, but a lingering question haunted her as she entered the final months of her first pregnancy.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he move more?”</p>

<p>Her doctor reassured her that the baby was just very calm.</p>

<p>The new mother-to-be assumed all was fine when she mistook cramps or contractions for baby kicks.</p>

<p>Then she swelled with excessive fluid.</p>

<p>That, too, wasn’t normal.</p>

<p>She didn’t learn something was very wrong until after she went for an ultrasound and was promptly sent to Trident Medical Center in North Charleston.</p>

<p>There, technicians hooked her to monitors but said nothing about her baby. They told her she was having contractions with two months to go until her due date. </p>

<p>Then they transferred her to the specialized care at the MUSC’s Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine.</p>

<p>It was March 2010, and her due date wasn’t until May.</p>

<p>At MUSC, Laura received a high-powered ultrasound to help doctors get a better look at what was going on.</p>

<p>One of the physicians told her the baby showed no signs of moving and no signs of breathing.</p>

<p>The only sign of life was his heartbeat.</p>

<p>The doctor then said, “I’m sorry, but we don’t think the baby will survive after birth.”</p>

<p>Laura gasped. She was blindsided and stunned. None of her previous doctors had even hinted death was a possibility for the baby she would name Noah.</p>

<p>The MUSC physician was surprised Laura hadn’t been told earlier.</p>

<p>“He thought we knew,” Laura said. </p>

<p>He tried reassuring her that there’s always hope. But Laura’s mind blurred. She found herself enveloped in “a whole horrible feeling of despair.”</p>

<p>“How could this be?” she wondered. “Kids don’t die nowadays!”</p>

<h3 id="nothing-to-do-but-wait">Nothing to do but wait</h3>

<p>Neither she nor her doctors could do anything but wait for Noah’s birth.</p>

<p>Laura covered her head as she walked from the examination room, not wanting to make eye contact with passersby who might ask about the baby she so obviously carried.</p>

<p>Noah didn’t wait for his due date. He was born prematurely on March 25, 2010. </p>

<p>MUSC neonatal specialists stood by to do what they could to save Noah. As soon as he was born, they rushed off with him. </p>

<p>A short time later, a doctor returned and whispered, “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Noah died moments after he was born.</p>

<p>An autopsy revealed he had a rare birth defect — believed to be genetic — that did not allow him to breathe, or move. His  peripheral nervous system, the nerves outside the brain and spinal column, basically did not work.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott Sullivan, director of MUSC’s Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, researched the case.</p>

<p>He found only one other instance that occurred in Paris in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Sullivan and his team set about trying to understand how the defect worked on the baby’s body and the genetics. They wanted to be able to tell Laura what risks she faced in a future pregnancy.</p>

<p>They pinpointed the indicators and determined what to look for by ultrasound, Sullivan said.</p>

<p>The physicians believed Laura likely had a 1-in-4  chance of the same thing happening again.</p>

<p>Some newborn deaths are simply unavoidable.</p>

<p>But Sullivan had a theory that the defect “might not manifest in the same way each time. There would be a chance that another child would be partially affected, and we could do something to help.”</p>

<p>If it occurred in exactly the same way, Sullivan said, “all we could do would be to plan and do palliative — like hospice — care."</p>

<p>Laura and her husband, Andrew, now a Boeing engineer, buried Noah in Magnolia Cemetery over Easter weekend.</p>

<p>On Easter day, Laura felt an overwhelming reassurance “like God is going to bless us with a lot of children. That’s when the spark of hope happened.”</p>

<p>Fourteen months later, Laura, now 33, gave birth to William.</p>

<p>In short order, he was followed by two more healthy children, Anna in 2013 and Jillian, “perfect and beautiful,” just last month.</p>

<p>Sullivan and his department’s specialists monitored each of the pregnancies.</p>

<p>Laura remembers the thrill that rushed over her when William moved and punched inside her.</p>

<p>“I said to myself, ‘So this is what it feels like to have a baby kick.’”</p>
